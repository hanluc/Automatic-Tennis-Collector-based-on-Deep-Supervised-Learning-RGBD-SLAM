# Automatic Tennis Collector

**Based on Deep Supervised Learning & RGBD-SLAM**

- Adopted U-Net implemented using Pytorch to segment out tennis balls from images taken by front camera 
- Adopted RGBD-SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping) as a mapping strategy for real-time robot self-locating
